In Java, concurrency refers to the ability of a program to execute multiple tasks or threads simultaneously, or at least seemingly so. This allows for better utilization of system resources and can improve the responsiveness and performance of applications.
Key points about concurrency in Java:
Threads:
The basic unit of concurrency in Java is a thread, which represents an independent path of execution within a program.
Multithreading:
Java supports multithreading, meaning you can create and manage multiple threads within a single program.
Benefits:
Concurrency can lead to:
Improved responsiveness: Tasks that don't depend on each other can run simultaneously, preventing one task from blocking others.
Better performance: By utilizing multiple cores or processors, you can achieve faster execution of tasks.
Efficient resource utilization: Threads can share resources like memory and I/O devices, optimizing their usage.
Challenges:
Concurrency also introduces challenges, such as:
Synchronization: Managing access to shared resources to prevent data corruption or race conditions.
Deadlocks: A situation where two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other to release resources.
Liveness issues: Problems like starvation, where a thread is never able to execute because other threads are constantly getting priority.
Java Concurrency Tools:
The java.util.concurrent package:
Provides a rich set of classes and interfaces for managing concurrency, including thread pools, executors, locks, semaphores, and more.
Synchronized keyword:
Used to ensure that only one thread can access a particular block of code or object at a time.
Atomic variables:
Classes like AtomicInteger and AtomicLong provide atomic operations that can be used to perform thread-safe updates on shared variables.
Volatile keyword:
Ensures that changes made to a variable by one thread are immediately visible to other threads.
