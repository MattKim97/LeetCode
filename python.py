# programming act of telling a computer what to do
# terminal is also known as the command-line, shell command prompt or console
# the Python programming language was released in 1991 by Guido van Rossum
# Python is an open-source programming language that is free to use and distribute
# Python has a small formal and rigid syntax
# includes identifiers, keywords, statements, code blocks, whitespace, and comments
# a variable is an identifier that labels a value
# a variable's value can change
# name is important for a variable so we remember what it is stored as
# each variable has a data type, inferred by the value assigned to it
# The standard input stream allows an application to capture text typed in the terminal. 
# The standard output stream allows an application to print text to the terminal window.
# Identifiers have hard rules. They are case sensitive. Whitespace is not permitted.
# Class identifiers should be CamelCase.
# Variable and function identifiers should be snake_case.
# No single character identifiers.
